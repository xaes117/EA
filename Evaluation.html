                    <h3>Summary of progress</h3><br>
                    <p>We adopted an Agile approach to project development. Each sprint lasted 2 weeks and was
                        synced with each bi-weekly report. The weights indicate the difficulty and importance of the
                        task. We used the Fibonacci numbers to separate the weights. A maximum of three tasks could be
                        assigned the same weight unless there is an exceptionally high number of tasks in the sprint
                        backlog for a given sprint.</p>

                    <p>As we were adopting an Agile approach to the project we decided to accomplish the most important
                        tasks within the first sprint. This meant creating MVPs of as many 'Must Have' requirements as
                        possible hence the large number of 'Must Have' requirements completed during the first sprint.
                        We managed to complete these tasks on time and evaluate the work for the next sprint.

                    <p>During this sprint we aimed to optimise the system as much as possible given the feedback from
                        the client. We also decided to tackle the core problems to make the system to improve the
                        scalability of the system. We made improvements to the core components including the Set Engine,
                        Interpretation Engine and the REST Service.

                    <p> Our project workload during the third sprint was less than usual due to Reading week and
                        Scenario
                        Week. We managed to fix the REST endpoints and integrate the Interpretation Engine to read files
                        from the Azure Blob and send these files to Team 1 via the REST API. We also wrote a basic
                        neural network to classify data types which was going to be used for the Set Engine to
                        differentiate sets.

                    <p>During the fourth sprint we further optimised our system after feedback from the client. We made
                        additional upgrades to the Set Engine with
                        a decision tree to create a greater variety of sets. In a pivot maneuver we made the decision to
                        remove the Interpretation Engine and integrate its parser with the REST service into one system.
                        We decided that it would be more efficient for charts to be created in the backend for the
                        reasons that sets can be loaded almost instantaneously and C# is disproportionately faster than
                        Javascript. To cater to this we created the Chart Engine that generates Chart Objects given a
                        REST request.
                        We also created a new API website.

                    <p>During the fifth sprint we made significant improvements to the blob storage system by upgrading
                        the set engine to produce a more efficient set structure. We suffered a major data loss but
                        managed to restore the data by creating a new database generation tool. We made further
                        improvements to the chart engine improving scalability as well as making significant updates to
                        the REST API including integration of the latest chart engine. We also made a lot of
                        optimisations by testing a variety of methods and choosing the most efficient solutions. We have
                        also explored additional approaches to the permanent storage of sets, and have made progress
                        towards integration with Team 1.

                        During the final sprint we focused on further system integration and pushing out the final
                        results of our research. We met with Team 1 several times to help integrate the product.
                        Additionally we conducted further meetings to work on the presentation, video and website. We
                        also created the system manual (Web API Website) and user manual for the project.

                        <b>Integration Engine</b>
                        <p>We tried to keep the architecture of the system as simple as possible. One major pivot
                            decision
                            was to remove the Integration Engine during the fourth sprint which was one of the main
                            components in our system. This was to simplify the process down. We realised that we did not
                            need a complex parser to map a request to a set but instead we could map a request directly
                            to a
                            set without any parsing. This greatly reduced complexity and improved the speed to
                            retrieving
                            sets as time was not wasted parsing.</p>

                    <div>
                        <b>REST API</b>
                        <p>
                            We tried to keep the URLs of our API uniform, by adhering to the common practice of using
                            singular nouns to suffix our requests. Due to the nature of our API, most (if not all) of
                            the requests are of the GET variety, so the action performed by each URL becomes quite easy
                            to decipher.
                            <br><br>
                            In an effort to add more features and to make the API more flexible, we found that we were
                            driven to increasing the depth of our URLs in a way which made the API unnecessarily
                            complex. To combat this, we changed our structure early on and we adopted the '?'
                            parametrisation format. For example, requesting a Set of Students along with their
                            MathsGrade would look like this:
                            <br><br>
                            /api/Set/Student/MathsGrade
                            <br><br>
                            but with the new design, it is much more intuitive:
                            <br><br>
                            /api/Set?setType=Student&setProperty=MathsGrade
                            <br>
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <b>REST API Error Handling</b>
                        <p>
                            For each type of request our API takes, we provide an informative error response when
                            something goes wrong. Providing useful error responses will help developers get to know the
                            API.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Set Engine</b>
                        <p>
                            The Set Engine and its Decision Tree are both singletons. This helps with keeping track of
                            the flow of data at runtime as the data is either in the Set Engine or in the Decision Tree.
                            The fork/join design pattern helps us to keep control of the threads and flow of the
                            program. Most importantly the fork/join pattern limits the number of sets in heap memory at
                            run time thereby helping to reduce the risk of an OutOfMemoryException. Once all threads
                            have joined the Set (along with its subsets) can be removed by the garbage collector and the
                            Set Engine will begin creating the next Set.

                            of the methods we tried. We also found that TCP and UDP are roughly the same in terms of

                            connector classes to connect to the database. We have experimented with ADO.NET to read from
                            SQL and MySQL databases and integrating this feature with the Set Engine can ensure
                            compatibility with SQL databases.</p>

                    <h3>Azure</h3>
                    <p>In terms of maintenance the system should be fully functional on Azure. For very large datasets
                        scaling to a more expensive VM may be required to increase the working memory of the Set Engine
                        at run time. With circa 10 million data points we noticed OutOfMemory exceptions on a standard
                        tier VM. We have tried to make the system more memory efficient by removing storage of Sets
                        after they have been uploaded to the Blob.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Set Engine Memory Feasibility</h3>
                    <p> If the entire application is single threaded
                        OutOfMemory exceptions are less likely to occur however the set creation process will be much
                        slower. It is important to consider the trade-off between speed and memory usage in
                        this instance. If the system is multi-threaded it will be faster but may also use up memory
                        faster than the garbage collector can remove it. On the other hand we can reduce the memory
                        usage but at the expense of increased computation time. We have implemented a fork/join design
                        pattern to help minimise memory usage while maximising speed. However even with the design
                        pattern a run without memory leaks are not guarenteed in all cases and so this should be a case
                        to be aware of when undergoing system maintenance.</p>
                    <h3>Set Engine Automation</h3>
                    <p>The Set Engine contains a suite of features for automation. The Set Engine can be run on the
                        Windows Tasks Scheduler application available on all Windows Servers 2012 and later. In addition
                        the Set Engine also includes an automated emailing service to notify administrators of any
                        defects that have occurred during a particular run and so problems likely to be identified and
                        solved quicker.</p>

                                    Problem<br>One of the main priorities of the project was to experiement with
                                    different methods of
                                    transporting and manipulating the data. SIMS face major difficulties with computing
                                    the data
                                    on a large scale so it was imperative for us to try our best to find the fastest
                                    possible
                                    methods for our clients.

                                    Methodology<br>We identified the key areas where the system was slowest. This was
                                    sending data over the REST API and computing the Chart objects. Once key areas for
                                    speed testing was identified we attempted multiple different solutions of solving
                                    the problem. We measured the average time for each solution and compared the
                                    solutions against each other.

                                    Conclusion<br>We found that JSON Splitting and multi-threading were the best
                                    solution as it had the fastest time for generating Chart objects and reading data
                                    from a database on the same server as the REST service had the fastest read time. We
                                    also discovered that sending a ZIP file was the fastest method of transportation.

                                be very fast for transporting data across a TCP stream. When two randomly sampled sets
                                were intersected (e.g. Two random
                                samples of 5000 IDs from two Sets) we found that the error rate of the intersection fell
                                below 0.1% after about about 13000 - 15000 random samples given a set of 500000 unique
                                IDs. This was unfortunately accompanied with the fact that no more than 60 observed
                                intersections occurred between two randomly sampled sets. This was bad in case the user
                                wanted to further intersect the new set with another set. As a result we decided to
                                stick with using ZIP files.

                        <p><br>
                            Due to miscommunication between our team, the department and our client we experienced major
                            set backs
                            during
                            the early stages of the project. The team was switched to a new project towards the end of
                            November giving us two weeks to gather new requirements, research and prototyping before the
                            website and video deadline for COMP204P. As a result this left us with a huge backlog of
                            work to do for next term.<br><br>To counteract the massive backlog of work
                            resulting from COMP204P we decided to adopt an Agile approach to developing the system. We
                            could therefore develop the most important features first and iterate towards an optimal
                            feature. We would only conduct further research and prototyping on the features that
                            worked and dropped the features that did not work. This gave us the time we needed to
                            develop the system to its best potential while also conducting the missed out research that
                            would have otherwise happened during Term 1.

                    <p>We analysed the progress of our sprints and noticed that 'Must Have' requirements show up most
                        frequently at the start. Then 'Should Have' requirements start increasing in frequency followed
                        by 'Could Have' requirements. By sprint 5 we had completed most of the 'Must Have' requirements
                        and'Should Have' and 'Could Have' requirements made up circa 80% of our workload. The number of
                        tasks related
                        to the final
                        submission (in green) also started to rise at the start of the fifth sprint and accounted for
                        almost 85% of our workload during the final sprint.

                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h3>Lazy Evaluation</h3>
                            <p>Another future development which can help make the data delivery faster and more
                                efficient, would be the introduction of a lazy data delivery system. The idea behind
                                this would be that only the data that is actually needed at that point in time would be
                                sent across to the client’s web browser.

                                For example, let’s say the client requests the data set “all students with the property
                                gender”, with a view of plotting a bar chart that showcases how many female against how
                                many male students the school(s) have. Bearing in mind that this could be data from
                                hundreds of schools, this would be a very large Json string to return. With lazy data
                                return, the values first returned would literally be just the ratios needed to plot the
                                bar chart (i.e. what our Chart Engine is doing now). Let’s then say that the client want
                                to view the actual student “within” the male subset of students. Instead of returning
                                the whole subset which could consist of thousands of students, the lazy system could
                                return only as many students as the screen/canvas area can fit at that moment, caching
                                the rest on the server for later delivery.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Because this is an education project, which has the potential to handle actual data from
                                schools, privacy and security should be a big part of any future development. One really
                                important thing to think about would be the access levels of different clients to the
                                data on the system’s servers. For example, clients from a particular school should only
                                be allowed to request data from their own schools, whereas local borough authorities
                                only data from their own borough.

                                    the School ID and the Academic Year as the primary keys.</p>

                                <p>The solution we proposed was to concatenate the primary keys to form the set. This
                                    resulted
                                    in

                                    the ID by a delimiter and see how this would interact with other sets. Given an
