                <h2>Gathering Requirements</h2>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of first term we received a

                    <a href="files/description.pdf">project description</a>

                    from our clients. It was really difficult to communicate with our clients to determine the sets of
                    requirements as they were not very reponsive.
                    From what we gathered from Team 1, the client required a backend that transferred the data to the
                    frontend efficiently.<br>
                    <br>
                    We managed, with the assistance from Dr. Strange, to arrange a meeting with a developer from SIMS on
                    12 January along with Team 1. During this meeting
                    the developer taught us about the set system. He described to us that their system currently
                    generates a database of sets and uses a chart engine to generate charts from the database of sets.
                    The system does not need to know what the database looks like in order to generate sets.

                    Based on the lists of requirements above we designed the following system to meet the client's

                        REST API:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>We decided to use the REST API to send data to Team 1 because of its robustness and relative
                            easy learning curve. In addition Visual Studio also has many skeleton projects and general
                            purpose support for backend REST services.</p>

                        <p>The interpretation engine is a system that interprets GET requests
                            sent from Team 1 by mapping the requests to a set in the set database.
                            It reads from the set database and returns the set to the REST controller.</p>

                        <br>
                        <p>The set engine includes a database connector which connects to a specified database. It reads
                            data from the database and creates sets using information from the database. The Set Engine
                            does not need to know the stucture of the database to craete the sets.</p>

                <h3>User Friendliness</h3>
                <p>We also carefully considered how the user will interact with our API. One of the major drawbacks to
                    APIs is the learning curve required to use the API. We therefore decided to make a simple three step
                    process (click-copy-paste) for the user so they can get started with the API as soon as
                    possible. (See Figure 2) </p>

                <h2>Final Requirements</h2>
                <p>Based on feedback from Team 1 and our client we added several extra requirements</p>

                <p>
                    Additional Functional Requirements:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li type="circle">A Chart Engine to generate charts</li>
                    <li type="circle">The Set Engine to generate a map of the storage system</li>
                    <li type="circle">Splitting of sets into further subsets</li>
                    <li type="circle">ZIP/UDP methods of transmitting data</li>
                    <li type="circle">Set Engine to be able to read from multiple databases</li>
                    <li type="circle">Experiment with more than one solution to visualising data</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Additional Non-functional Requirements:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li type="circle">Chart Engine to have a scalable design</li>
                    <li type="circle">Provide a documentation introducing how to use the API</li>
                </ol>

                <br>

                <p>We decided to integrate the Interpretation Engine with the REST service because we were over
                    complicating the process of retrieving sets. By creating a map of the set storage we can retrieve
                    any set using a 1 to 1 mapping which is much simpler no parsing is required.<br><br> We decided to
                    include a Chart Engine in our system because Team 1 are generating charts in Javascript once they
                    receive the sets from the REST endpoint. This can be exceptionally slow as Javascript is much slower
                    than C# and sending a simple Chart object in JSON takes much less time than sending sets that
                    contain potentially millions of data points.</p>

                <p>
                    Based on the final requirements, we updated the diagram
                </p>
                <div align="middle">
                    <img src="images/Solution2/solution2.png" width="800" align="middle">
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Figure 3: Schematic diagram to show the overview of the final system
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>There is a further second solution created as this was primarily an experimental project set by the
                    client and so we decided that it would be helpful to provide multiple different solutions to a
                    problem as this would diversify our risk and help us find a more optimal solution.</p>
