                <h2>System Architecture</h2>

                <p>
                    The system is comprised of three major components. The REST API, the Chart Engine and the Set
                    Engine.
                    Additionally there are several important subcomponents including general purpose Readers, Writers
                    and a number of helper classes to help facilitate the running of each major component. Data is
                    stored in a blob on Azure.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Set Engine<br><br>This program generates sets and writes the sets to the Azure blob. The
                            Set
                            Engine does not need to know the structure of the database in order to generates the sets
                            but splits
                            tables into columns and generates sets based on the column data. The Set Engine should be
                            run
                            automatically a weekly basis using the Windows Task Scheduler to ensure data on the blob is
                            up to date.
                            After
                            every run of the Set Engine results are emailed to whomever the user desires.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The Chart Engine<br><br>The Chart Engine is a general purpose program for generating charts.
                            The idea originally came from the fact that Team 1 were generating the charts based on our
                            data. This can be very slow as we will need to send many sets to Team 1 in order for them to
                            generate charts. If we instead move the Chart Engine to the backend then the charts can be
                            generated much faster because no sets will be required to be sent to the frontend which can
                            be
                            very slow depending on the size of the set.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>The REST API<br><br>The REST API was our chosen medium for communicating data to front end
                            developers. We specifically chose to use the REST API because of its wide use, small
                            learning curve and general availability on multiple platforms. We used controllers to carry
                            out different types of tasks and created a suite of unit tests for each controller.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Supporting Libraries<br><br>During the development of the three programs above we developed
                            several libraries that were regularly used throughout the course of the project. The Blob
                            Reader and Writer classes were the main classes that were used most extensively. Some
                            additional important libraries include a Graph Retriever that is used to link the REST API
                            to the Chart Engine, a database generation tool that we created to generate sample databases
                            and a simple decision tree that we used to classify data types which was needed for the Set
                            Engine.</p>
                    </li>

                <p>We created a series of UML diagrams to help us visualise what the system should look like before

                </h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Singleton</b>
                        <p>There are a number of Singletons throughout our project. One notable pair of singletons is
                            the
                            Set Engine and its Decision Tree.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Model View Controller</b>
                        <p>We have implemented a controller design pattern in the REST API. Different controllers are
                            responsible for controlling the flow of information for different classes of sets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Fork/Join Pattern</b>
                        <p>The Fork/Join pattern was implemented in the Set Engine. A group of sets created would fork
                            from the main thread then they would each create their own individual subsets. When the
                            forked thread has uploaded its data onto the blob it will join with the main thread and wait
                            for the others to finish.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Resource Orientated Architecture</b>
                        <p>
                            We implemented this design pattern into our REST API where the string parameters of the URI
                            map to some set or function. Different combinations of URIs will lead to different forms of
                            resource usage.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Test Mode for complex functions</b>
                        <p>Due to the complexity of the Set Engine we encountered some difficulties testing the output.
                            This was because the Set Engine would perform operations such as uploading data into the
                            blob and write emails to staff informing them of the latest run. In order to counteract this
                            we developed a design pattern to run unit tests on complex functions such as the Set
                            Engine.<br><br>We created a Test Mode for the Set Engine. When in Test Mode a separate
                            database for testing will be used. The Set Engine will avoid performing critical functions
                            such as emailing clients. When the data is generated it will then be run against a series of
                            unit tests. The idea is displayed in Figure 4 where the green path is the path taken when in
                            Test Mode. Critical functions are avoided and a test suite is run.

                        <b>Information Chaining</b>
                        <p>One major difficulty faced was retrieving information from Sets. Due to the size of the sets
                            retrieving certain information was computationally expensive and took a long time. As a
                            result we implemented a system of chaining information to retrieve certain attributes about
                            the set without having to perform expensive computations against the entire set. (Figure
                            5)</p>
                        <figure>

                            In the diagram above the "-info" identifier will return certain information regarding the
                            set called "MySet".
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                "-info-size" will return the size of the set.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                "-info-type" will return the type of the set.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        These values are pre-calculated and so there is no need to retrieve the entire set to calculate
                        this information. The information chained can be anything depending on the choice of the
                        developer.

                        the same procedure but returns the full set.</p>

                        Engine immediately pushes sets to the Azure Blob after each set is created. When all tables have
                        been checked the Set Engine pushes a map to the blob that contains the location of each set it
                        has created. The Set Engine then emails the system administrator with details on the latest

                        We decided to switch from the file system to the Azure blob. The Azure blob is much more
                        scalable and we can create many different blobs for different databases which would be
                        significantly harder to do on a file system. The blob shown in Figure 10 is the blob created by
                        the Set Engine from the database shown in Figure 9.

                    <p>In order to create more meaningful sets we need to differentiate the parent sets into subsets. In
                        order to achieve this the first step to take was to identify what the set contains. To complete
                        this subgoal we had to identify the data type making up the set. This problem is shown in Figure
                        11 which was the Set Engine output without creation of subsets.</p><br>

                        vector being the different datatypes. The input vector would be a series of attributes of the
                        set that we believe would be useful for identifying its datatype.<br><br>We managed to create a
                        basic feed forward network in C# but had trouble implementing the back propagation which had
                        many bugs that we were unable to debug.</p>

                        the Set Engine which allowed it to split the sets into subsets (e.g. percentiles).

                        that uses random samples to generate chart data that would resemble real life data accurately
                        and thus we created the above prototype.</p>

                        new project. The developer from
                        SIMS taught us how their current system works. He informed us that their current engine can
                        create sets without knowing the structure of the database but he did not explain how. The key
                        idea we took from the meeting was the idea of sets and so we modified our original prototype for
                        sets instead of random samples.

                        centrepiece of our system. There would be other smaller side features, research and experiments
                        on the side but this would be what we hoped to work towards throughout the project.

                        directly to a set without having to do extensive parsing. The mapping and removal of the
                        Integration Engine meant made the system simpler and faster.

                        Near the beginning of March we were experimenting with different ways to generate charts. We
                        figured that Team 1 would be creating Charts on the front end which meant they were calling
                        several sets from our Blob. This meant transporting several sets each containing millions of
                        data points across a TCP stream. To speed this process up we thought that it would be much
                        faster
                        to just create the charts in the backend and send Team 1 a Chart object or even an ND3 Chart
                        object in which they can plot
                        the graph. As a result we added a Chart engine and added features to support line graphs, bar
                        charts and pie charts.

                        2 attempts to
                        find a set in the main database. If the sets are not found in the database then the system will
                        attempt to create a new set and store it in memory so that it may be used for quicker reference
                        next time the set is called. Overtime this will compound and the majority of sets will be able
                        to be retrieved immediately without any prior filtering or modification.
