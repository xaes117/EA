                <h2>Speed Tests</h2>
                <p>We have run several speed tests including reading data from different resources, generating chart
                    graphs in front-end and back-end, and so on. Below are the results we got from the speed tests.</p>

                <b>Some terminology</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Random Sample: The random sample with a scalar is a method where we randomly select 1000 samples
                        and send this to the front end along with a scalar multiple so the number can be multiplied back
                        up to the real set.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JSON Splitting: This is where we split the string with delimiters and count the
                        resulting array. It happens to be the size of the set.
                    </li>
                    <li>Dictionary Size: This is the value of parsing the JSON
                        string into a Dictionary Object and returning the size of the Dictionary.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <b>Other Information</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>We were unable to obtain results from UDP but from <a
                            href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24648118/in-windows-azure-does-the-cloudblockblob-putblock-method-use-tcp-or-udp-as-the">research</a>
                        we managed to find that UDP/TCP
                        speeds were fairly similar. The data is also shown in Figure 5.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Set Engine</b>
                        <p>Due to the complexity of some of the functions in the Set Engine it was a bit difficult to
                            create
                            automated tests for the Set Engine. (e.g. some processes upload data to the blob which
                            should not
                            happen during a test). To overcome this problem we simply added an optimal test parameter to
                            the Set
                            Engine which when called will put the Set Engine into test mode.</p>
                        <figure align="middle">
                            <img src="images/UnitTest.png" width="700">

                        <p>When in test mode the Set Engine reads from a Test Database and the output is tested against
                            a set of
                            known output sets by
                            calling the CompareSets(TestSet, PredictedSet) function where 'TestSet' is the answer and
                            'PredictedSet' is the set generated by the Set Engine. Every single item in the Test and
                            Predicted
                            Set must match in order for the unit test to pass.</p>

                        <b>REST API</b>
                        <p>For the REST API we created a series of test for each controller to test against expected and
                            actual I/O. We retrieved the set in JSON and checked if the set was empty. If the set was
                            empty then the test case will fail.</p>

                <p>The Set Engine is meant to work with any relational database without knowing the structure of the
                    database. In order to test this out we decided to run the Set engine against several different mock
                    databases we created.<br></p>

                            the blob. Note that the green icons are sets that can retrieved by front end developers. The
                            cloud icons (leaf nodes on the tree) are an abstraction of the multiple subsets resulting
                            from the parent set (the non-leaf node that is green). Each parent set can have up to
                            hundreds of sub sets hence the cloud icon to represent multiple sets.<br></p>

                    Methodology
                </h3>
                <p>The main people using the Web API will be front end developers<br><br>As a result we decided to ask
                    several computer science students including members from Team 1 whom we were working closely with to
                    review several API calls on <a href="https://postcodes.io/docs">postcode.io</a> and then obtain
                    feedback regarding their experience. This was because postcode.io had roughly what we had in mind
                    and asking users what they liked about it would greatly help us find the best way to make our API as
                    friendly as possible<br><br>Some students had not used the REST API before so we
                    guided them on usage. We decided to conduct an open discussion session while the user used the API
                    as we believed that receiving
                    feedback while the user was using the product would be the most realistic feedback as it would
                    reflect closely to what developers were thinking while they were using the API.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    We found that users found it easy to call REST requests from the address bar in their web browser.
                    More inexperienced users of REST APIs showed more interest in the URI approach whereas a handful of
                    experienced users used REST tools including Postman to call the REST requests. As a result we
                    decided to opt for the URI approach as this would be the easiest for beginners to learn.
